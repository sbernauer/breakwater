Pixelflut server powered by breakwater https://github.com/sbernauer/breakwater
Available commands:
HELP: Show this help
PX x y rrggbb: Color the pixel (x,y) with the given hexadecimal color rrggbb
{}
PX x y gg: Color the pixel (x,y) with the hexadecimal color gggggg. Basically this is the same as the other commands, but is a more efficient way of filling white, black or gray areas
PX x y: Get the color value of the pixel (x,y)
SIZE: Get the size of the drawing surface, e.g. `SIZE 1920 1080`
OFFSET x y: Apply offset (x,y) to all further pixel draws on this connection. This can e.g. be used to pre-calculate an image/animation and simply use the OFFSET command to move it around the screen without the need to re-calculate it
