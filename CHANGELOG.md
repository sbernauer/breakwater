## [0.16.0] - 2024-08-19

### Added

- Added support for binary sync protocol behind the `binary-sync-pixels` feature ([#34])
- Added support for native display output ([#38])

### Changed

- BREAKING: Feature `binary-commands` has been renamed to `binary-set-pixel` ([#34])
- BREAKING: Remove the `breakwater-core` crate ([#37])
- Add a `FrameBuffer` trait, rename the existing implementation one to `SimpleFrameBuffer` ([#37])
- Add a `DisplaySink`Â´trait, so that new sinks can be added more easily ([#38])
- BREAKING: No display sink is now started by default. To start the VNC server add the `--vnc` CLI argument ([#38])

### Fixed

- Performance improvement due to addition of missing set of `last_byte_parsed` when sending binary pixel commands ([#36])
- Minor performance improvement when parsing `HELP` and `SIZE` requests ([#36])

## [0.14.0] - 2024-05-30 at GPN 22 :)

### Added

## [0.13.0] - 2024-05-15

### Added

- Also release binary for `aarch64-apple-darwin`

### Changed

- Second rewrite with the following improvements: ([#21])
  * Put `Parser` behind a trait, so that we can have multiple implementations in parallel
  * Use cargo workspaces
  * Better error handling using snafu
- BREAKING: Build release binaries without support for VNC, as this
  * Has a dependecy on a dynamically linked library on the host executing the binary
  * Needs a cross-compilation (which didn't work), as the macOS GitHub runners all run on arm and we try to build an x86 binary
